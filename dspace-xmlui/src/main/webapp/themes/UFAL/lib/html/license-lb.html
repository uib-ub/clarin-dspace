    It is hereby agreed as follows: 
    <br/>

    <div class="well well-sm">

	    <li>
	    <p>This agreement is made on the <span class="emphasis"><em>date of submission</em></span> and effective immediately.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>The User is granted a non-exclusive license to use LB to extract information directly or indirectly in any form and volume, provided that LB itself or any derivative work is used only by the User her/himself or his/her immediate collaborators, employees, managers and/or her/his students from the same Institution for research purposes only, and provided she/he is continuously observing all the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. If any part of LB contains its own license or an additional restriction, the more restrictive version and/or amendment of the license shall be in effect, unless specifically stated otherwise in such a part. In particular, all the documentation which is provided should be considered a personal copy of the respective Author's reprint and handled as such.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>The User shall not use LB itself or any derivative work (including but not limited to statistics obtained by using it or any derivative work thereof) based on it (however small the contribution of LB to such derivative work is) in whatever form for commercial purposes of any kind, nor for a deployment in any routinely used application, regardless whether it is of commercial nature or not.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
			<p>The User shall include the following notice in all publications or publicly available materials, regardless of their form (printed, electronic, or other), describing work which uses LB: "<span class="quote">The Dictionary of Medieval Latin in Czech Lands: Digital Version 2.2, Prague: Filosofický ústav AV ČR, v. v. i., 2019. Available at: <code class="literal">http://lb.ics.cas.cz</code>.</span>"</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>The User agrees not to re-distribute or otherwise make publicly available LB, or any derivative work based on it as described in paragraph 3, to a third party without a prior written permission of the Proprietor, with the exception of examples and citations as described in paragraph 4.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>The User undertakes to adopt any security measures needed to protect the Proprietors' copyright in LB and undertakes to take all reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized use is made of LB and of any copies, derivative works or extracts thereof.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>Any usage of LB which does not conform to the specification set forth in the 3rd paragraph of this Agreement (such as, e.g., commercial usage of LB) is subject of separate negotiations and a written contract between the User and the Proprietor and/or other parties. The Proprietor is in general not obliged to enter and/or conclude such negotiations.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>LB is provided as is. Therefore, the Proprietor does not warrant the usefulness of LB for any purpose, regardless of formulations which can be found at some places in the accompanying documentation stating the intended purpose and use of LB.</p>

	    <li>
	    <p>If the User reports to the Proprietor any discovered errors, inconsistencies or suggested corrections or improvements to LB, the Proprietor undertake: (a) to maintain these comments in confidence and to use them only for the purposes of improving, modifying and/or maintaining LB, (b) not to disclose the comments except in confidence to those of their employees or directors who need to know the same for the aforesaid purpose.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>Should the Users by themselves or anyone acting on their behalf fail to comply with any of the conditions in this agreement (save with the written consent of the Proprietor) this agreement shall terminate immediately and LB, its copies and derivative works based on it shall be destroyed at the User's site and at all sites under his control. Such termination shall be without prejudice to any claim which the Proprietor may have either for monies due and/or damages and/or otherwise.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>Failure by the Proprietor to exercise or enforce any rights in this agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any such right nor operate so as to bar the exercise or enforcement thereof at any time or times thereafter.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>This agreement terminates if (a) the User destroys all copies of LB or any derivative work thereof, (b) the User or its Institution ceases to exist, unless all its obligations are transferred to a new entity, which is then considered to be bound by this Agreement. The User or its successor shall inform the Proprietor about any such transfer or succession; failure to do so will terminate this Agreement after one month after such transfer or succession. (c) the Proprietor ceases to exist without a legal successor.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>The Proprietor shall keep the information about the User provided when submitting this Agreement in confidentiality and will not disclose it to other parties, except in a summary form such that individual users will not be identified, unless they specifically agree to such a disclosure in writing.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and all disputes concerning this agreement will be resolved by its jurisdiction.</p>
